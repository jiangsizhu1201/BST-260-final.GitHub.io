**Data Source:** “Flavors of Cacao,” which can be retrieved from tidytuesdayR (Hughes 2022) chocolate rating data (18-01-2022).The ratings (as the Flavors of Cacao claimed) do not reflect health benefits, social missions, or organic status. 

The raw dataset includes 2530 observations and 10 variables, namely ref, company_manufacturer, company_location, review_date, country_of_bean_origin, cocoa_percent, ingredients, specific_bean_origin_or_bar_name, most_memorable_characteristics, and rating.

**Here are some glimpses from the dataset:**
